# Flex Management System
FAST NUCES FLEX Management System
This repository contains the code and documentation for the FAST NUCES FLEX Management System, which is a database management system designed to handle and schedule academic information for university students. The system aims to streamline various aspects of student management, including enrollment, course registration, scheduling, and performance tracking.

Motivation
The goal of the FLEX Management System is to enhance the overall academic experience for students at FAST NUCES while optimizing the university's operational efficiency. By providing students with access to their academic information and schedules, and enabling the university to manage resources and course offerings effectively, the system aims to improve the student management process.

Features
The FLEX Management System offers the following features:

User Management
The system incorporates a comprehensive user management module to cater to different user roles, including Academic Officers, Faculty, and Students. Each user is assigned a user account, which grants them access to the relevant functionalities and interfaces.

Academic Office Interface
The Academic Office interface provides Academic Officers with the authority to offer courses, manage student enrollment by assigning courses, and allocate courses to Course and Lab Instructors. The interface allows for course offerings to be displayed to students, considering course prerequisites. Additionally, the Academic Officers can create course sections, ensuring a maximum of 50 students per section and limiting students to a maximum of 6 courses per semester. The interface also includes features to generate reports such as offered courses, students section-wise, and course allocations.

Faculty Interface
The Faculty interface is designed for faculty members who teach courses. They have the ability to set marks distribution for assignments, quizzes, sessionals, and finals. The interface enables faculty members to manage attendance, evaluate students, and generate grades based on the assigned marks. The faculty can also generate reports, including attendance sheets, evaluation reports, grade reports, and counts of grades in a specific section.

Student Interface
The Student interface allows students to access and manage their academic information. Students can view their attendance records, evaluation marks for each registered course, their transcript, and graphical representations of their previous semester CGPAs. Additionally, students can provide feedback to teachers using a designated feedback form.
